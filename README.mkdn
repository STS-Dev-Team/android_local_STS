Local manifest addon for CM ICS kexec on OMAP4 devices

Getting Started
---------------

Initializing a Build Environment
--------------------------

Installing the JDK
-------------------

The Sun JDK is no longer in Ubuntu's main package repository. In order to download it, you need to add the appropriate repository and indicate to the system which JDK should be used.


Installing Java 6/7 jre and jdk using oad-java.sh
-------------------------------------------------

How do I download and run this thing?
-------------------------------------
Like this.

	cd ~/
	wget https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/raw/0.2.6/oab-java.sh -O oab-java.sh
	chmod +x oab-java.sh
	
To install the Java 6 jre/jdk

	sudo ./oab-java.sh
	
To install the Java 7 jre/jdk

	sudo ./oab-java.sh -7

If you are behind a proxy you may need to run using:

	sudo -i ./oab-java.sh
	or
	sudo -i ./oab-java.sh -7

If you want to see what this script is doing while it is running then execute
the following from another shell:

	tail -f ./oab-java.sh.log

How it works
------------

This script is merely a wrapper for the most excellent Debian packaging
scripts prepared by Janusz Dziemidowicz.

* https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6
* https://github.com/rraptorr/oracle-java7

	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk

Or if you ran the script with the -7 option.

	sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jre
	sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jdk

If you already have the *"official"* Ubuntu packages installed then you
can upgrade by executing the following from a shell.

	sudo apt-get upgrade

Installing required packages
----------------------------

64-bit (recommended)


    sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential \
    zip curl zlib1g-dev:i386 libc6-dev lib32ncurses5-dev ia32-libs \
    x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev:i386 lib32readline-gplv2-dev lib32z-dev \
    libgl1-mesa-dev:i386 g++-multilib mingw32 tofrodos python-markdown \
    libxml2-utils xsltproc libncurses5-dev:i386 libreadline6-dev:i386 \
	pngcrush schedtool 
    
    
On Ubuntu 10.10:

    sudo ln -s /usr/lib32/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib32/mesa/libGL.so
    
On Ubuntu 11.10:

    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libX11.so.6 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libX11.so

Create the Directories
----------------------

You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.

To create them run:

    mkdir -p ~/bin 
	mkdir -p ~/android/system
	
Install the Repository
----------------------

Enter the following to download make executable the "repo" binary:


curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo

	chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Now open up your bashrc (nano ~/.bashrc) and add the following to the end:

	PATH=~/bin:$PATH

Save the file and source it:

	source ~/.bashrc

	cd ~/bin

	repo init

You may need to reboot for these changes to take effect. 


Now enter the following to initialize the repository:

	cd ~/android/system/
	

To initialize your local repository using the Cyanogemod manifest, use commands like these:

    repo init -u git://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b ics
    
    curl -L -o .repo/local_manifest.xml -O -L https://raw.github.com/STS-Dev-Team/android_local_STS/ics-cm-kexec/local_manifest.xml

    	( or Download: https://github.com/STS-Dev-Team/android_local_STS/blob/ics-cm-kexec/local_manifest.xml
		and place it in ~/Android/.repo/local_manifest.xml (or ~/'name you chose'/.repo)

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Building the System
-------------------

The basic sequence of build commands is as follows:

Initialize the environment with the envsetup.sh script. Note that replacing "source" with a single dot saves a few characters, and the short form is more commonly used in documentation.


	. build/envsetup.sh
	lunch

Enter the number of the build you want to start and press enter
